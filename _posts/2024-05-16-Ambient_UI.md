## What is Ambient UI(from Claude)
Ambient User Interface, refers to a concept in user experience design that aims to seamlessly integrate technology into our everyday environments in a non-intrusive and contextually aware manner. The idea behind Ambient UI is to make technology blend into the background, providing information and services when needed without demanding our explicit attention or interaction.

### Key aspects of Ambient UI

1. Ubiquitous computing: Ambient UI leverages the widespread availability of computing devices, sensors, and network connectivity to create a digitally augmented environment. This includes smart devices, wearables, and even everyday objects with embedded computing capabilities.

2. Context awareness: Ambient UI systems are designed to be aware of the user's context, such as their location, activity, and surrounding environment. This awareness allows the system to anticipate the user's needs and provide relevant information or services without explicit input.

3. Passive interaction: Rather than requiring direct input from the user, Ambient UI systems rely on passive interaction methods, such as voice commands, gestures, or even physiological signals like eye movements or brain activity.

4. Minimal disruption: Ambient UI aims to minimize disruptions to the user's primary task or activity. Information and services are presented in a subtle and unobtrusive manner, allowing the user to focus on their main task while still benefiting from the technology.

5. Ambient displays: Ambient UI often utilizes ambient displays, which are displays integrated into the environment that provide information in a peripheral and non-intrusive manner. Examples include digital signage, projected displays, or even ambient lighting.

6. Multimodal input/output: Ambient UI systems may employ multiple input and output modalities, such as voice, gestures, haptic feedback, and ambient sounds or visuals, to provide a more natural and intuitive interaction experience.

### Goal of Ambient UI
To create a seamless and intuitive user experience where technology blends into our daily lives, providing relevant information and services without demanding our explicit attention or disrupting our primary tasks. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of smart homes, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices and environments are becoming increasingly connected and intelligent.

## Evaluation
As conversational MultiModal AI technology evolveld, it is expected that there will be a need for AI Assistant-related technology that analyzes the user's context and provides appropriate services.
Ambient UI is a design required to provide UX optimized for the above technologies.
