This is a review of Veritasium's YouTube video The 4 things it takes to be an expert.

## What is an expert?
A person who recognizes patterns and uses them to gain insight

### How to develop professionalism
Through repetitive learning, patterns are recognized and used to derive insights.

### Expertise cannot be developed
It is difficult to demonstrate expertise in an environment with high uncertainty that cannot be controlled by humans.
The reason is that it is difficult to predict the next situation through past patterns.

## Why Professional Growth Stops
Experts may become accustomed to patterns they have already learned and may be reluctant to learn or recognize new patterns.

### Why we need to get out of our comfort zone
This may not lead to the best insights or may lead to a tendency to remain stuck in past technologies.
Currently, this pattern-finding expertise is rapidly being replaced by AI.

### How to develop our expertise
We need to continuously find new patterns and think about better solutions.
